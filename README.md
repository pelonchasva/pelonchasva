# Hi, I'm Andres :smiley:

I am a Software Engineer :computer: who is passionate about open-source software and try to contribute to it as much as possible, this is my way to give back to the community for creating awesome tools that I can use on my daily work or just as a hobby.

Most of my experience is around Microsoft technologies such as C#, .NET Framework/Core, ASP.NET WebForms/MVC, EF, LINQ.

When it comes to databases, I have experience using SQL Server as main relational database system, writing queries that might be either simple or complext, stored procedures, tables and views and jobs using SQL Server Agent.

I also have experience in web development :scroll: using HTML, CSS and Javascript, at some point in my career, I have used AngularJS v1.0 and ReactJS, but just the basic stuff, I'm still trying to learn these technologies.

If you would like to collaborate with me in some project that you have in mind or if just want some friend to play video games :video_game: with, feel free to contact me in any of my social media accounts:
